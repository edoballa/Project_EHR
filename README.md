# Project_EHR
This project combines a Triplet Network (PyTorch), with an AdaBoost classifier to perform feature embedding and classification on dataset. The primary goal is to generate meaningful embeddings for each sample using a deep learning model and then apply these embeddings to train a robust classifier.
